Novorender lets you highlight sets of objects.
This could be used to visualize current object selection, or groups of objects, for instance the results of data queries.

### Object Identity

All the objects in a scene are enumerated and assigned a unique integer id/index, expressed as <code>[ObjectId](/docs/webgl-api/interfaces/NovoRender.PickInfo#objectid)</code>.

One way of obtaining such an id is using the <code>[pick()](/docs/webgl-api/interfaces/NovoRender.View#pick)</code> function, which lets you pick the frontmost object, if any, at the given x,y canvas coordinate.

```typescript
const result = await renderOutput.pick(x, y);
if (result) {
    const { objectId } = result;
}
```

### Object highlighting

To highlight the picked object, we must create a highlight object.
Highlighting works by performing a linear transform of the red, green, blue and alpha (opacity) channels.
For now, we'll simply make the selected object lime green.

```typescript
const red = 0.0;
const green = 1.0;
const blue = 0.0;
const highlightGroup1 = api.createHighlight({
    kind: "color",
    color: [red, green, blue],
});
```

Highlights are applied to groups of objects.
By default, all objects are assigned to group #0.
To make our picked object stand out, we assign it to group #1.

```typescript
scene.objectHighlighter.objectHighlightIndices[objectId] = 1;
scene.objectHighlighter.commit(); // call this to commit all changes
```

To make our selected objects stand out even further, we make all other objects less colorful by halving their color saturation.

```typescript
const highlightGroup0 = api.createHighlight({ kind: "hsla", saturation: 0.5 });
```

We then assign these highlights to our two groups, default and selected respectively:

```typescript
view.settings.objectHighlights = [highlightGroup0, highlightGroup1];
```

:::note
Currently, there are a maximum of 256 highlight groups, the last one (#255) being reserved for objects that should not be rendered.
