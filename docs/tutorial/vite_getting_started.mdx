import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';



## Setup

To begin, let's initiate a new Vite + TypeScript project from scratch:

<Tabs groupId="npm2yarn">
  <TabItem value="npm" label="NPM">

```bash
# npm 6.x
npm create vite@latest my-novorender-app --template vanilla-ts

# npm 7+, extra double-dash is needed:
npm create vite@latest my-novorender-app -- --template vanilla-ts
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="yarn" label="Yarn">

```bash
yarn create vite my-novorender-app --template vanilla-ts
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="pnpm" label="pnpm">

```bash
pnpm create vite my-novorender-app --template vanilla-ts
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Once the above command has run successfully, you should notice a newly created directory named `my-novorender-app`. Navigate into this directory, and then proceed with the following commands to complete the project creation process:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

Open the project in your favorite IDE and you should see a directory structure something like this:

```
ðŸ“¦ my-novorender-app
 â”£ ðŸ“‚public
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œvite.svg â›”
 â”£ ðŸ“‚src
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œcounter.ts â›”
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œmain.ts â›”
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œstyle.css â›”
 â”ƒ â”£ ðŸ“œtypescript.svg â›”
 â”ƒ â”— ðŸ“œvite-env.d.ts
 â”£ ðŸ“œ.gitignore
 â”£ ðŸ“œindex.html
 â”£ ðŸ“œpackage.json
 â”— ðŸ“œtsconfig.json
```

Let's clean up this project by removing some redundant files, so we don't have any unnecessary boilerplate code left, delete the files marked with â›” symbol. Afterward, create an empty file named `main.ts` within the `src` directory.

### Installing Web API
Run the following command to install the Novorender Web API package:
```bash npm2yarn
npm i --save @novorender/api
```
The NPM package contains pre-built [ESM](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Modules) bundles for the main script and worker scripts as well as the binary resource dependencies. We removed support for legacy UMD modules.
:::info
A copy of all the original typescript source code along with sourcemaps is included too. We consider the source code an important part of our documentation.
:::
Besides installing the package, you must make sure the files in the `public/` directory of this package are available to your server, this is covered in next section.

### Copying required resources
Before we move forward to actually implementing the Novorender Web API, we need to find some way to copy the resources from `node_modules/@novorender/api/public` to Vite's [`/public`](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) dir, one way of doing this is to create a node script and use [`fs`](https://nodejs.org/api/fs.html) module to copy the files. However, there are alternative methods, such as using [vite-plugin-static-copy](https://www.npmjs.com/package/vite-plugin-static-copy) or [CopyWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/copy-webpack-plugin/) if you are using Webpack. The choice of implementation ultimately depends on your preference, but for the sake of flexibility across different bundlers, we will proceed with the Node script approach.

Create a file named `copy.js` and insert the following JavaScript code within it:
```javascript title="copy.js"
import { promises as fs } from "fs";

const sourceDir = "node_modules/@novorender/api/public";
const destDir = "public/novorender/api";

await fs.cp(sourceDir, destDir, { recursive: true });
```

:::info
The above script utilizes some newer APIs, so please make sure your nodejs version is `>= 16`.
:::

To execute this script, use the `node copy.js` command. Assuming that the execution was successful, you should now see all the copied resources in `/public/novorender/api/` directory.

:::tip
You can automate the process of copying the required resources by adding this command to npm's `postinstall` hook. This way, the necessary resources will be copied automatically whenever project dependencies are installed with `npm install`.
:::

### Server requirements

Our API uses advanced, cutting edge javascript APIs, many of which comes with certain security requirements. In general, the following two global properties have to be true: [`isSecureContext`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/isSecureContext) and [`crossOriginIsolated`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/crossOriginIsolated).

To make it all work, your server has to ensure:

1. A [secure context](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Security/Secure_Contexts). In practice, this means HTTP on localhost (for debugging only) and HTTPS everywhere else, including LAN.

2. Cross origin [HTTP headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/SharedArrayBuffer#security_requirements) for *top level documents*.
```http
Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy: same-origin
Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy: require-corp
```

This can be done by adding the following headers in Vite config file.
Create a new file named `vite.config.ts` in the project's root directory and paste the following code into it:
```typescript title="vite.config.ts"
export default {
    server: {
        headers: {
            "Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy": "same-origin",
            "Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy": "require-corp",
        }
    }
}
```

<details>
      <summary>Adding headers via <b>ModHeader</b></summary>
      

If the above method of adding headers doesn't work or you don't have access to the build configuration, you can utilize the [ModHeader](https://modheader.com/) browser extension. This extension allows you to modify HTTP request and response headers, providing an alternative way to address header-related issues.     

![ModHeader usage demonstration gif](/img/modheader.gif)

</details>

:::info
It's important to note that the method described above for enabling Cross-Origin headers is primarily intended for development mode. When transitioning to a production environment, you will need to configure these headers on your server. The specific implementation will depend on the server you are using, so please consult the relevant documentation for detailed instructions.
:::

3. MIME type [`text/javascript`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/text/javascript) for javascript files and [`application/wasm`](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/application/wasm) for web assembly files.

4. Any resources loaded from a separate domain has be configured with [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) to allow your domain.

5. Service workers script at the appropriate location, preferably at the root of your domain. See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ServiceWorkerContainer/register) for more.

### Typescript

Using our APIs from javascript is possible but *strongly discouraged*. We rely heavily on typescript to help users catch common errors at edit/compile time. Technical support will only be provided for typescript users.

This package is built using version <WebApiTypescriptVersion /> of typescript. As a rule of thumb, you should upgrade to the latest version of typescript whenever a new version is released.

If you plan to do your own bundling and use our sources directly, you may want to use our `tsconfig.json` as a baseline for your own:

```jsonc
{
  "extends": "node_modules/@novorender/api/tsconfig.json", // or wherever...
  "compilerOptions": {
    ...
  }
}
```

We generally use `ESNext` as target since we only support latest version of browsers with cutting edge support for 3D rendering. Also, we use relatively new typescript features such as [`verbatimModuleSyntax`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#verbatimModuleSyntax) and [`allowArbitraryExtensions`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#allowArbitraryExtensions).


## Writing some code
Now that we have a proper project in place, we can go ahead implementing the actual API.

### Providing required resources 
Before we create a [view](https://docs.novorender.com/docs/guides/views), we need to provide it with some [resources](https://docs.novorender.com/docs/guides/views#prerequisites);
- Canvas
- Device profile
- Imports

These resources are crucial for setting up and configuring the view properly.

#### Canvas
To begin, let's create an HTML canvas element:
```html title="index.html"
<canvas id="canvas" style="width:100%; height:100%"></canvas>
```
:::info
It's crucial to set the CSS `width` and `height` properties on the canvas element to prevent runaway resize feedback loops. This ensures that the canvas has the correct dimensions and behaves as expected.
:::

Now, open the `src/main.ts` file and insert the following code to obtain a reference to the canvas element we created earlier:
```typescript title="main.ts"
const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas");
```

#### Device profile
Get the device profile:
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { getDeviceProfile } from "@novorender/api";

const gpuTier = 2;
const deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile(gpuTier);
```

#### Imports
[Remember](#providing-required-resources) we copied some resources from `@novorender/api` to our `/public` dir? that's where they come into play.
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { View } from "@novorender/api";

const baseUrl = new URL("/novorender/api/", window.location.origin);
const imports = await View.downloadImports({ baseUrl });
```

<details>
      <summary>Getting Error: `Cannot find module '/novorender/api/shaders.js`</summary>
      <div>In certain build environments or bundlers, you might encounter complaints about `shaders.js` not being found. In such cases, you will need to provide the `shaders` separately to resolve this issue.</div>

```typescript
// @ts-expect-error
import { shaders } from "@novorender/api/public/shaders";

const imports = await View.downloadImports({ baseUrl, shaders });
```

:::info
`// @ts-expect-error` is essential because TypeScript might incorrectly assume that the `@novorender/api` doesn't expose this module, even though it does and this will tell TypeScript to suppress that error from being reported.
:::

</details>

### Creating View
With all the necessary components in place, we can proceed to create and run our view:
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { View } from "@novorender/api";

const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, imports);
await view.run();
```

Finally, call the <CodeLink type="class" name="view.dispose" /> method to clean up the view's GPU resources.
```typescript title="main.ts"
view.dispose();
```

Let's consolidate all the steps and components we've discussed and see the result:
```typescript title="main.ts"
import { View, getDeviceProfile } from "@novorender/api";

const canvas = document.getElementById("canvas") as HTMLCanvasElement;

async function main(canvas: HTMLCanvasElement) {
    const gpuTier = 2;
    const deviceProfile = getDeviceProfile(gpuTier);
    const baseUrl = new URL("/novorender/api/", window.location.origin);
    const imports = await View.downloadImports({ baseUrl });
    const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, imports);
    await view.run();
    view.dispose();
}

main(canvas);
```

:::tip
Avoid [deep imports](https://gist.github.com/daleyjem/0f38f561a4e91e58eba580889f38330f)! Everything you need should be available from the package root: `@novorender/api`.
:::

Start the development server by running the following command:
```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

:::tip
Furthermore, you can run the project we've built above directly by clicking the button below:

[![Open in StackBlitz](https://developer.stackblitz.com/img/open_in_stackblitz.svg)](https://stackblitz.com/github/novorender/novorender-examples/tree/master/vite-vanilla-ts)
:::

Upon successful execution, you should now see an image with a subtle gray gradient:
![application screenshot initial view](/img/guides/tutorial-001.png)

Let's make it a little more interactive by modifying `renderState` and adding a <CodeLink type="interface" name="RenderStateGrid" />.
```typescript title="main.ts"
...
const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, imports);
view.modifyRenderState({ grid: { enabled: true } });
await view.run();
...
```
![application screenshot grid view](/img/guides/tutorial-002.png)
:::info
You can learn more about the `RenderState` [here](/docs/web_api/Interfaces/interface.RenderState) and experiment with it by adding or modifying some of its properties. This will help you better understand how to customize rendering behaviors.
:::
:::tip
The view already has camera controller built in so you can interact with the view by holding down the left-click on your mouse or trackpad. Alternatively, you can use the movement keys and <kbd>W</kbd><kbd>A</kbd><kbd>S</kbd><kbd>D</kbd> to navigate and move the camera around in the view.
:::
:::info
The view will automatically resize your canvas' pixel size when the css layout and/or the render state output settings changes.
