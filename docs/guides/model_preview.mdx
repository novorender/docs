Imagine you have a scene with a couple of models and then someone uploads a new model,
but this model seems to be out of place.
It would be nice if you could easily put the model where it should be without changing the original file.

When a new file is added to the scene - there's a step in the pipeline that creates a low detail .glb file for the model.
That's the file we're going to use. It becomes available once original file conversion completes.

## Locating the file

First we need to find the file. To do this we'll use [REST API](/docs/category/data_rest_api/v2).
To make request it's easier to use [DataApi.fetch](/docs/data_js_api/api_reference/namespaces/DataJsAPI/interfaces/API#fetch).

```typescript
const 
```

<PlaygroundComponent demoKey="modelPreview.preview" />
