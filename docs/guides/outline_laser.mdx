Laser Measurement can be done on a clipping outline, both visualizing the outline and clipping by the plane are optional.
To place a laser <CodeLink type="class" name="View.outlineLaser"/> should be used. This function will give a list of intersections with the outline in all directions (left, right, up, down) starting closest to the laser point.
The laser position in the demo is calculated by using the position of a <CodeLink type="class" name="RenderContext.pick"/> and the camera position as a segment and calculating the intersection by using <CodeLink type="function" name="segmentPlaneIntersection"/>.
The laser can be used on both outline planes and clipping planes with outlines.

### Outline Laser Demo

:::tip
Click anywhere on the model to see the intersection, then click the 'Show Previous' or 'Show Next' buttons to cycle between points.

### Outline Laser without Clipping Planes

:::tip
Click anywhere on the model to see the intersection, then click the 'Show Previous' or 'Show Next' buttons to cycle between points.
