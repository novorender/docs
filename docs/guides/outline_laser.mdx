Laser Measurement can be done on a clipping outline, both visualizing the outline and clipping by the plane are optional. To place a laser <CodeLink type="class" name="View.outlineLaser"/> should be used, select a point, this could be the position of a <CodeLink type="class" name="RenderContext.pick"/>, outline laser will then do a projection from the camera to the selected point and add a laser at the intersection of the chosen plane. The function will give a list of intersections with the outline in all directions (left, right, up, down) starting closest to the laser point.
