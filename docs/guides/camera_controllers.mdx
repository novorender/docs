Before we dive into camera controllers, let's examine what they control exactly.
The camera orientation and projection used for rendering is described in the render state as a 3D vector and quaternion.

```typescript
const position = [0, 0, 10];
const rotation = [0, 0, 0, 1];
const kind = "pinhole"; // perspective projection
const fov = 60; // field of view in degrees
view.modifyRenderState({
    camera: { kind, position, rotation, fov },
});
```

If you're using the `Core3D` module only, this would be how you control the camera.

For anything beyond trivial cases, however, manually setting the camera state can be a daunting task.
To help with this, the <CodeLink type="class" name="View"/> class introduces camera controllers.
These will overwrite the camera related render state on every frame, so setting it directly like in the example above usually won't work.
For the sake of understanding, we select the inert <CodeLink type="class" name="NullController"/> so we can play around with the camera state ourselves.

## Active controller

A view comes with a preset selection of camera controllers, all listed in the <CodeLink type="class" name="View.controllers"/> property.
Only one of them can be active at a time, however, defined in the 'view.activeController' property.

```typescript
const { activeController } = view;
```

You can change the active controller using the <CodeLink type="class" name="View.switchCameraController"/> method.

```typescript
const flightController = await view.switchCameraController("flight");
```

This function also attempts to reconcile the different types of states contained in each type of controller to provide a reasonable transition.

## Common controller functionality

All controllers inherit the <CodeLink type="class" name="BaseController"/> type, which contains common functions and properties.
An example of this is the `serialize` and `init` functions that can be used to persist controller state as JSON.

```typescript
const controllerState = activeController.serialize();
activeController.init(controllerState);
```

## Type assertions and guards

For type specific functions and properties, you'll need to narrow down the type.

One way to do this is to call the <CodeLink type="class" name="View.switchCameraController" /> function, which will switch to and return the specific type you requested.

If all you have available is <CodeLink type="class" name="View.activeController"/>, you could downcast to the specific subtype, but this is potentially unsafe and not checked at runtime.
Instead we provide typescript type assertions and type guard helper functions to assist you.

By default, the view comes with an orbit camera controller.
This controller works well for examples and simple use cases, so we'll keep using it for a while.
We can assert that <CodeLink type="class" name="View.activeController"/> is in fact an orbit controller.

```typescript
const { activeController } = view;
OrbitController.assert(activeController);
// activeController is OrbitController from now on.
```

Also, it tells typescript that `activeController` is an orbit controller, allowing us to access the members of this class instead of the common base class.

:::info
If the active controller is any other type, the assertion throws an exception.
:::

If you're not sure what type the controller is, you could use type guards to check

```typescript
if (OrbitController.is(activeController)) {
    // activeController is OrbitController in this scope
}
```

If you don't care what controller is current active but just want to access a specific kind, you can always get it via the <CodeLink type="class" name="View.controllers"/> property.

```typescript
const { orbit } = view.controllers;
```

## Parameters

Each controller type has its own set of parameters.
Having asserted the active controller is indeed an orbit controller, let's double the default rotational speed to give us a more responsive rotation!

```typescript
const { activeController } = view;
OrbitController.assert(activeController);
activeController.updateParams({ rotationalVelocity: 2 });
```

<PlaygroundComponent demoKey="cameraControllers.controllerParams" />

## Properties

Controllers have several properties that you can get and set.
We could, e.g., halve the field of view and double the distance for a dolly zoom-like effect.

```typescript
activeController.fov /= 2;
activeController.distance *= 2;
```

Unlike the other controllers, the orbit controller doesn't have an intrinsic position that you can set directly.
It is instead computed from the `pivot` point, `distance` and `yaw` + `pitch` angles.
Hence, moving the pivot point will also move the camera position indirectly.

```typescript
let [x, y, z] = activeController.pivot;
x += 1; // Move one meter to the right.
activeController.pivot = [x, y, z];
```

The same applies to rotation, which is expressed as two angles, `yaw` and `pitch`.
One reason for this is to restrain the orientation to have zero roll angle.
Roll can be confusing and is rarely useful in an engineering context.

## Zoom to and fly to

All controllers support the notion of zoom to and fly to.
Both of them support an animated motion from the current position to the desired target.

<CodeLink type="class" name="BaseController.zoomTo" /> brings a bounding sphere into view in a sort of "zoom to fit" manner. This is useful for displaying an object or area with a known bounding sphere.

<CodeLink type="class" name="BaseController.moveTo" /> moves the camera to the desired position, and optionally rotation.

## Other kinds of camera controllers

The <CodeLink type="class" name="FlightController"/> is more flexible than orbit and lets you move freely around in a first person, hovering flight manner.
There are some variations of this controller for varying input preferences.

The <CodeLink type="class" name="PanoramaController"/> has a fixed position, letting you rotate only, typically to view a panoramic image.

The <CodeLink type="class" name="OrthoController"/> uses orthographic projection, which often is used to view content in a 2D projection style.

The <CodeLink type="class" name="NullController"/> is a completely passive camera controller that will not modify/overwrite any camera render state.
This can be useful for manually setting such state.

## Custom controllers

In case the built-in controllers don't fit your need, you can also make your own.
To do this you'll need to make a new controller factory function.

```typescript
function myCameraControllers(input: ControllerInput, pick: PickContext) {
    return {
        ...builtinControllers(input, pick),
        mine: new MyController(input, pick),
    } as const;
}
```

This must then be passed on to the <CodeLink type="class" name="View.constructor"/>.

```typescript
const view = new View(canvas, deviceProfile, myCameraControllers);
const myController = view.controllers.mine;
```

The first controller in the list is initially active, i.e. the default.

Your camera controller must inherit from `BaseController` and at the very least implement the abstract methods.
Alternatively you can inherit from one of the existing concrete controller classes.
More details of how this works is covered in a separate guide: [Custom Camera Controller](./custom-camera-controller).
