Although the [ObjectGroup interface](https://docs.novorender.com/legacy/docs/data-js-api/interfaces/DataJsAPI.ObjectGroup) itself is not particularly noteworthy,
the <code>[SceneData.objectGroups](https://docs.novorender.com/legacy/docs/data-js-api/interfaces/DataJsAPI.SceneData#objectgroups)</code> property can be extremely useful.
Object IDs in Novorender are not fixed and may change whenever the scene's resources are modified.
Therefore if you store the IDs from a search (e.g. all objects on the first floor) and then later modify the scene's resources,
the scene's objects' IDs may have changed and your stored list of IDs will be stale.

The search patterns assigned to each object group is run every time a scene's resources are modified so that the list of IDs always will be correct.
That way you can easily create cached searches by using object groups.

When the <code>[objectGroups.ids](https://docs.novorender.com/legacy/docs/data-js-api/interfaces/DataJsAPI.Bookmark.ObjectGroup#ids)</code> list becomes extensive, the `.ids` property will be `undefined` and must be explicitly loaded, as demonstrated in the [Floors demo](#floors-example).

## Creating a group

```typescript
// Search utility function to return array of object IDs
async function search(scene: Scene, searchPattern: SearchPattern[]): Promise<number[]> {
    const iterator = scene.search({ searchPattern });

    const result: number[] = [];
    for await (const object of iterator) {
        result.push(object.id);
    }

    return result;
}

// Search pattern to assign to group
const searchPattern: SearchPattern[] = [
    {
        property: "path",
        value: "Farger.IFC/3/Surface:2481563/Apartment with 12 condos/2ND FLOOR",
        exact: true,
    },
];

const secondFloor: ObjectGroup = {
    // This search is run on the server every time the scene is rebuilt
    // and the resulting object IDs are saved to the group.ids property
    search: searchPattern,
    // The search is not run when the groups are saved
    // so you have to run it client side and set the .ids property yourself when you create the group
    ids: await search(scene, searchPattern),
    // Search deep
    includeDescendants: true,
    // The remaining properties are not used for anything on the server
    // Group id - UUIDv4 in this case, but it's up to you
    id: "56196cbf-f5aa-4f65-9934-911546f89225",
    name: "2nd floor", // Display name
    grouping: "", // We use this as a path style string to nest groups in the UI
    color: [1, 0, 0, 1], // Can be used to highlight objects in group
    selected: false,
    hidden: false,
};

// Before saving it is a good idea to load the latest scene data
// in case it has been modified by someone else as there is currently no way of just adding groups
const sceneData = await dataApi.loadScene(SCENE_ID);

dataApi.putScene({
    // Keep most of the data
    ...sceneData,
    // scene.id is the id of the main/admin scene while SCENE_ID is the viewer scene id
    url: `${SCENE_ID}:${scene.id}`,
    // Overwrite .objectGroups
    objectGroups: [secondFloor],
});

// Now that the group is saved the .ids property will be kept up to date by the server
```

## Modifying groups

### Edit a group
```typescript
// Load scene data
const sceneData = await dataApi.loadScene(SCENE_ID);
// ID of group to edit
const toEdit = "56196cbf-f5aa-4f65-9934-911546f89225";
// Create new array with the changes applied.
// In this case name is set to "Updated name"
const updatedGroups = sceneData.objectGroups.map((group) => (group.id === toEdit ? { ...group, name: "Updated name" } : group));

// Save scene
dataApi.putScene({
    ...sceneData,
    url: `${SCENE_ID}:${scene.id}`,
    objectGroups: updatedGroups,
});
```

### Delete a group
```typescript
// Load scene data
const sceneData = await dataApi.loadScene(SCENE_ID);
// ID of group to delete
const toDelete = "56196cbf-f5aa-4f65-9934-911546f89225";
// Create new array without the group to delete
const updatedGroups = sceneData.objectGroups.filter((group) => group.id !== toDelete);

// Save scene
dataApi.putScene({
    ...sceneData,
    url: `${SCENE_ID}:${scene.id}`,
    objectGroups: updatedGroups,
});
```

## Floors example

In this example, we've established predefined groups for each floor and implemented buttons to isolate [objectGroups](https://docs.novorender.com/legacy/docs/data-js-api/interfaces/DataJsAPI.Bookmark-1#objectgroups) within the group corresponding to the selected floor.
