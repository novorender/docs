While Novorender is mostly about streaming and rendering large, static 3D scenes, sometimes you may want to add smaller, dynamic 3D objects into the view.
Dynamic objects are meant for small and lightweight objects, such as 3D widgets or avatars.

## Loading from glTF

One way to create dynamic object is to load them from a glTF file.
Currently we support [glTF 2.0](https://www.khronos.org/gltf/) (.gltf/.glb).
You can download these from any url, but we do provide a few gltf models on our server: https://api.novorender.com/assets/gltf/

```typescript
var objects = await downloadGLTF(url);
view.modifyRenderState({ dynamic: { objects } });
```

The <CodeLink type="function" name="downloadGLTF"/> function returns an array of objects,
one for each node in the [glTF node hierarchy](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html#nodes-and-hierarchy).

You may inspect and/or modify this state prior to rendering.

:::info
Please note that we don't currently support any glTF extensions. Nor do we support animations or skinning, among other things.
We recommend verifying your files using https://github.khronos.org/glTF-Validator/ or similar before use.

Let's try to download a binary gltf file (glb), which has all the textures and buffers included in a single file.

### Procedural geometry

The glTF loader is not magic.
It returns render state that you can generate yourself in code.
The dynamic object render state <CodeLink type="interface" name="RenderStateDynamicObject"/> is quite rich and complex, similar to that of glTF.
Procedural geometry is intended for experienced 3D programmers.
Thus, this guide will not delwe into the complexities of geometry and materials, but rather explain how to get started.
For more detail, see the [glTF 2.0 specification](https://registry.khronos.org/glTF/specs/2.0/glTF-2.0.html) or [Learn OpenGL](https://learnopengl.com/).

Let's create a triangle from scratch.
To do so we need three vertices.
Vertices are described by vertex attributes.
For this demo we only need vertex positions.
Positions can be described as an array of float triplets, each triplet describing the x, y and z coordinate of each vertex.

```typescript
const vertices = new Float32Array([
    0,
    1,
    0, // xyz #0
    -1,
    0,
    0, // xyz #1
    1,
    0,
    0, // xyz #2
]);
```

Next, we need to describe the geometry of our object.
In this case, we have only one vertex attribute (positions), and are rendering triangles from 3 vertices, which gives 1 triangle only.

```typescript
const geometry: RenderStateDynamicGeometry = {
    primitiveType: "TRIANGLES",
    attributes: { position: { kind: "VEC3", buffer: vertices } },
    indices: 3, // # vertices
};
```

Our object also needs a materials.
For simplicity, we're just making a basic unlit material with green color.

```typescript
const material: RenderStateDynamicMaterial = {
    kind: "unlit",
    baseColorFactor: [0, 1, 0, 1], // green, opaque
};
```

A mesh consist of primitives, where each primitive has a geometry and a material.
Since we only have one material, the mesh will have only one primitive.

```typescript
const mesh: RenderStateDynamicMesh = {
    primitives: [{ geometry, material }],
};
```

Finally, we can make our object.
Each object has a mesh and a set of instances for that mesh.

```typescript
const triangleObject: RenderStateDynamicObject = {
    mesh,
    instances: [{ position: [0, 0, 0] }],
};
```

This all may seem overly complex for a single triangle.
The complexity is there to for good reason, allowing seasoned 3D programmers to take advantage of the GPU.
Most of the time you will use some kind of library to generate geometry for you.

The generated object needs to be inserted into the render state, just like we did with the glTF objects.

```typescript
view.modifyRenderState({ dynamic: { objects: [triangleObject] } });
```

So, let's see it all run.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.dynamic.triangle}></PlaygroundComponent>

## Instances

For this section we will use a simple helper function provided with the API to create a cube: <CodeLink type="function" name="createCubeObject"/>.
It is intended for demo and tutorial purposes only.
Feel free to inspect the source code linked in the reference documentation to see how it's implemented!

Instancing is a GPU hardware feature that will render the same mesh multiple times with virtually no overhead.
This becomes important when you want to draw hundreds, if not thousands of objects.
Note that instances aren't free, just as triangles aren't free.

```
total_triangle_count = num_instances * instance_triangles
```

Most modern GPUs can handle millions of triangles with ease, however.
Draw calls, not so much.
Instances are drawn in a single batch operation without javascript or the CPU getting in the way.
So if you have a simple object like this cube with 12 triangles each, you can easily have thousands of instances, or even tens or hundreds of thousands.
Let's start easy with `10 x 10 x 10 = 1000` instances, which produces 12K triangles.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.dynamic.instances}></PlaygroundComponent>

Try modifying the `dim` variable to increase/decrease # instances.
Most PCs should be able to handle millions of triangles, so if you feel adventurous, change `dim` to `100`, which produces one million instances.
12 million triangles may not render all that fast on less powerful GPUs, but it illustrates how the total triangle count, not the # instances is the main limitation.
This becomes even more true if the object you are instancing have more triangles than a measly 12.

Each instance may have an independent position, rotation and scale.
Only position is mandatory.
Omitting rotation and scale may reduce the cost of converting the javascript render state into a GPU state/buffer.

:::info
Changing dynamic objects render state that involves large arrays can be a costly affair and may cause frame rate stuttering.
Once the state has been copied to the GPU and left unchanged, performance typically becomes GPU-bound for subsequent frames.

## Scene graph and animation

The instance matrices are all in world space.
Why is there no scene graph, you may ask.
The quick answer is performance and simplicity.
The longer answer is that not everyone needs a scene graph.
Nor is it obvious that a strict hierarchy is the best way to organize nodes.
What if you have a physics engine, or some kind of constraint/inverse kinematics system?
Ultimately, a scene graph is a mere convenience and trivial to implement yourself if you absolutely must have one.

Nodes loaded from glTF will have their matrices converted into world space and made into a flat list.
If you wish to animate things, you will have to do so yourself.
In general, we discourage lenghty/constant animations.
This is because whenever the render state changes, the frame has to be completely re-rendered, which costs energy.
Also, progressive post effects and high-res rendering are often only applied after a small period of inaction.
Short animation sequences of seconds or less are fine, however, and may help the user to better understand function and context.

:::caution
Animations will drain device batteries quickly. Use with moderation!

## Dynamic object picking.

Just like in a static scene, dynamic objects can be picked.
To enable picking, you must assign a value to <CodeLink type="interface" name="RenderStateDynamicObject.baseObjectId"/>.
Since static scenes starts at id `0`, you should pick a high value to avoid clashes.
The object id is an unsigned 32 bit integer, so `0xf000_0000` seem like a good choice.

Each instance will be assgined an id from the base id value, thusly: `instance_object_id = baseObjectId + instance_index`.
In this example we only have one instance, so the base id becomes the only id we need to test for.
If you click on the cube, it should grow by 10%.
If you click outside the cube, it should shrink by 10%.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.dynamic.pick_dynamic}></PlaygroundComponent>

Dynamic objects don't support the same highlight mechanism that static objects do.
Unlike static geometry, dynamic objects are, well, dynamic.
You are free to change their appearance any way you'd like to "highlight" them.

:::info
It is up to you to manage object ids for dynamic objects. Take care to avoid clashes!
