Searching will be integral part of most applications using Novorender.
In the example below we demonstrate a few different search patterns where the resulting objects are isolated in the view.  
Make sure to also check out the <code>[db.search()](https://docs.novorender.com/docs/data-js-api/interfaces/DataJsAPI.ObjectDB#search)</code> documentation.

### Search By Path

Example of a Path search pattern where the isolated objects represent the results.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.searching.search_by_path} />
<br />

### Fluffy Search

Fluffy search pattern that looks for terms beginning with "Roof" in all properties.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.searching.fluffy_search} />
<br />

### Exact Search

Exact search that only checks the property "ifcClass" and the exact value "ifcRoof".

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.searching.exact_search} />
<br />

### Exact Search Excluding Results

Very similar to the Exact search pattern, but with exclude. All objects other than those located above will be returned.

<PlaygroundComponent {...snippets.searching.exact_search_excluding_result} />
