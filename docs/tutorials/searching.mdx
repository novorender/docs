Searching will be integral part of most applications using Novorender.
In the example below we demonstrate a few different search patterns where the resulting objects are isolated in the view.  
Make sure to also check out the <code>[Scene.search()](/docs/webgl-api/interfaces/NovoRender.Scene#search)</code> documentation.

### Search By Path

Example of a Path search pattern where the isolated objects represent the results.

<PlaygroundComponent {...tutorials.searching.searchByPath} />
<br />

### Fluffy Search

Fluffy search pattern that looks for terms beginning with "Roof" in all properties.

<PlaygroundComponent {...tutorials.searching.fluffySearch} />
<br />

### Exact Search

Exact search that only checks the property "ifcClass" and the exact value "ifcRoof".

<PlaygroundComponent {...tutorials.searching.exactSearch} />
<br />

### Exact Search Excluding Results

Very similar to the Exact search pattern, but with exclude. All objects other than those located above will be returned.

<PlaygroundComponent {...tutorials.searching.exactSearchExcludingResult} />
